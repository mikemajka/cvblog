### **Electrical Member**  
**September 2024 â€“ current | University of Toronto RoboSoccer**  

Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to design, prototype, and test electronic systems for autonomous soccer-playing robots. Led the development of a microcontroller-based PCB integrating motion, pressure, and light sensors. Ensured reliable data acquisition and signal integrity under dynamic conditions. Supported rapid iteration cycles and contributed to system integration with mechanical and software subsystems.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Designed and rapid-prototyped a custom microcontroller PCB for robot control.
- Integrated sensors (motion, pressure, light) to optimize real-time data acquisition.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless system integration.
